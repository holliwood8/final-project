## Olimpia's Final Project for COGS 118A

**Comparison of Random Forest, Linear SVC, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes on Four Datasets from the UC Irvine ML Repository**

### Overview

This project explores the performance of four supervised machine learning classifiers—Random Forest, Linear Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Naive Bayes—on binary classification tasks across four datasets from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The analysis examines performance across varying training set sizes and evaluation metrics, including accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repo

2. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook to view the analysis and results:
jupyter notebook final_project.ipynb  
source code at `source.py`

4. `tables` folder contains csv tables summarizing the results  

### Datasets

The project utilizes 4 datasets from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php):

- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**  
- **Spambase Dataset**  
- **Heart Disease Dataset**  
- **Adult (Income) Dataset**
